                    Poshn is a health drink brand which makes Functional Super juices. We call it a functional super juice because each variant has a certain function to perform once you consume it. One variant would recharge your body with herbs like Ginseng while the other would relax your body with the help of Chamomile flower extracts and other nutritional fruits.</p>
